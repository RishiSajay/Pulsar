# Pulsar
Pulsar is a 2D player v player battle royal where the last one standing wins. Pulsar was largely influenced by the popular computer game Tank Trouble and was fully developed fully in Unity. Players can either play 2 player or 3 player locally. Single player is still in development.

I have included the Assets folder and the final build. The entire project was too large to upload, and everything I used to build the game is in the Assets folder.
